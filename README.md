# AI Playground üß™ü§ñ

Welcome to my AI Playground! This repository is my personal sandbox for exploring, experimenting, and learning about the latest and greatest in Artificial Intelligence. Here, I'll be diving into various AI tools, models, frameworks, and techniques.

The primary goal is hands-on learning and understanding through implementation and experimentation. Think of it as a digital sketchbook for AI ideas.

## üéØ What You Might Find Here

*   **Model Explorations:** Testing out different pre-trained models (LLMs, vision models, diffusion models, etc.) from various sources (Hugging Face, OpenAI, Anthropic, local models).
*   **Framework & Library Trials:** Getting hands-on with libraries like:
    *   Hugging Face Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, Tokenizers
    *   PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX
    *   LangChain, LlamaIndex
    *   Scikit-learn
    *   And many more!
*   **Technique Implementations:** Small projects demonstrating concepts like:
    *   Fine-tuning models
    *   Prompt Engineering strategies
    *   Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
    *   Vector Databases (e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB, Weaviate)
    *   Agent-based systems
    *   Model quantization and optimization
    *   Model Context Protocol (MCP)
*   **Tool Integrations:** Experimenting with AI APIs, services, and MLOps tools.
*   **Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs):** Quick prototypes to test out specific AI ideas or workflows.
*   **Learning Notes & Snippets:** Useful code snippets, observations, and mini-tutorials derived from experiments.

Each experiment folder should ideally contain its own `README.md` explaining the specific setup, purpose, and findings of that experiment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools (Potential List)

This is a non-exhaustive list of technologies I might explore here:

*   **Languages:** Python (primarily)
*   **Core ML/DL Libraries:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, Scikit-learn
*   **LLM & NLP Ecosystem:** Hugging Face (Transformers, Diffusers, etc.), LangChain, LlamaIndex, spaCy, NLTK
*   **Model Providers/APIs:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Google Gemini, Hugging Face Hub (PLLuM, Bielik etc.)
*   **Vector Databases:** FAISS, ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant
*   **Development Environments:** Jupyter Notebooks/Lab, VS Code, Google Colab
*   **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
*   **Version Control:** Git (for data, potentially)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is a **playground**, not a production environment.
*   Code here is primarily for learning and experimentation.
*   It may not be optimized, thoroughly tested, or follow best software engineering practices.
*   Functionality might be incomplete or change frequently.
*   Use any code or insights at your own risk.
